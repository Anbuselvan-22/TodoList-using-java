## 💡 How It Works

The to-do list application uses several key Java concepts:
- 📦 **ArrayList** - Dynamic array for flexible task storage
- 🔄 **Do-While Loop** - Keeps the menu active until user exits
- 🎮 **Switch-Case** - Handles different menu operations
- ✅ **Input Validation** - Prevents invalid task removal
- 🧹 **Buffer Clearing** - Handles newline consumption after integers

## 🔧 Code Highlights

- 📦 **ArrayList Usage**: Dynamic storage that grows/shrinks automatically
- ✅ **Index Validation**: Prevents out-of-bounds errors when removing tasks
- 🔄 **Loop Control**: User-controlled exit with do-while loop
- 🧹 **Clean Input Handling**: Properly manages Scanner buffer
- 🎯 **User-Friendly**: Numbered task display for easy reference

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- 📚 Working with Java Collections (ArrayList)
- 🎮 Menu-driven program design
- ✅ Input validation techniques
- 🔄 Loop control structures
- 💾 Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
